![Header image](res/silly_banner/TF.jpg)

> This is a small Java game project for class excercises

  
  The game is inspired from [Ryi Snow](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq) tutorial.
  Basic package and class structure are the same as tutorial with some optimization i made.
